#Employee in and Out
#Outline:
#Write a program to create a class with the named employee and create a constructor and destructor. Then, write a function to create an object for that class and delete the object. Make sure you call the function to get everything implemented!

class Employee:
    def __init__(self):
        print("Employee created")
    def __del__(self):
        print("employee destroyed")
    
    def Create_obj():
        print("making obj")
        obj = Employee()
        print("function end")
        return obj
    
print("calling the object")
obj = Employee()
print("programing")
