#Outline:
#Write a program where the value of i begins from 1 and goes to 10. When the value of i becomes 5, force the interpreter to exit the program.

for i in range(10):
	
	# If the value of i becomes
	# 5 then the program is forced
	# to exit
	if i == 5:
		
		# prints the exit message
		print(exit)
		exit()
	print(i)
